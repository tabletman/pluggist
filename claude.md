# Claude Code Instructions

## Code Analysis and Optimization

Please analyze this codebase (/Users/bp/projects/GitHub/pluggist/pluggist) with the following objectives:

1. Identify and fix any code that's not appropriate or following best practices:
   - Security vulnerabilities
   - Deprecated API usage
   - Accessibility issues
   - Compatibility problems

2. Optimize code efficiency:
   - Identify performance bottlenecks
   - Reduce unnecessary computations
   - Improve memory usage
   - Optimize render performance
   - Enhance bundle size

3. Provide educational explanations:
   - For each issue found, explain:
     - What the problem is
     - Why it's problematic
     - How the fix improves the code
     - Best practices to follow in the future

4. Prioritize changes by:
   - Critical issues (security, major performance)
   - User-facing improvements
   - Developer experience enhancements
   - Nice-to-have optimizations
