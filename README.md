```javascript
// Example MCP tool usage
const chargingStations = await mcp.call('find_charging_stations', {
  location: 'Cleveland, OH',
  radius: 5,
  connector_type: 'CCS'
});

const deals = await mcp.call('get_nearby_deals', {
  station_id: 'tesla-van-aken',
  categories: ['food', 'shopping']
});
```
