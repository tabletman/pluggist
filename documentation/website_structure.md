## Wireframes

Detailed wireframes for key pages will be created using a design tool like Figma. The wireframes will focus on:

1. **Home Page**
2. **Search Results Page (Map View)**
3. **Search Results Page (List View)**
4. **Charging Station Details Page**
5. **Trip Planner Page**
6. **User Dashboard**
7. **Business Dashboard**

## Responsive Design Strategy

The website will follow a mobile-first design approach with three main breakpoints:

1. **Mobile (< 640px)**
   - Simplified navigation with hamburger menu
   - Single column layouts
   - Reduced map size with option to expand
   - Touch-friendly UI elements

2. **Tablet (640px - 1024px)**
   - Two-column layouts where appropriate
   - Expanded navigation
   - Larger map area
   - Sidebar for filters and additional information

3. **Desktop (> 1024px)**
   - Multi-column layouts
   - Full navigation
   - Split view for map and list results
   - Advanced filtering options visible

## Performance Optimization

1. **Image Optimization**
   - Next.js Image component for automatic optimization
   - Lazy loading for off-screen images
   - WebP format with fallbacks

2. **Code Splitting**
   - Component-level code splitting
   - Route-based code splitting
   - Dynamic imports for heavy components

3. **Caching Strategy**
   - Static generation for content that doesn't change often
   - Incremental Static Regeneration for semi-dynamic content
   - Client-side fetching with SWR for real-time data
   - Redis caching for API responses

4. **Core Web Vitals Optimization**
   - Minimize Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
   - Optimize First Input Delay (FID)
   - Reduce Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)

## Accessibility Considerations

1. **WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance**
   - Proper heading structure
   - Sufficient color contrast
   - Text alternatives for non-text content
   - Keyboard navigation support

2. **Assistive Technology Support**
   - ARIA labels where necessary
   - Screen reader testing
   - Focus management

3. **Inclusive Design**
   - Resizable text without breaking layout
   - Support for reduced motion preferences
   - Clear error messages and form validation

## SEO Strategy

1. **Technical SEO**
   - Server-side rendering for improved indexing
   - Structured data (Schema.org) for rich results
   - XML sitemap generation
   - Canonical URLs to prevent duplicate content

2. **On-Page SEO**
   - Optimized title tags and meta descriptions
   - Semantic HTML structure
   - Internal linking strategy
   - Location-based pages for improved local SEO

3. **Content Strategy**
   - Regular blog posts on EV charging topics
   - Comprehensive guides for new EV owners
   - Location-specific content for popular areas
   - User-generated content through reviews

## Security Measures

1. **Authentication**
   - NextAuth.js for secure authentication
